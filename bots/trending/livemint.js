You are given a list of trending news articles from a general news page. For each article, extract and return a structured JSON object in the following array format **without any extra text, markdown, or backticks**:

[
  {
    "title": "<title of the article>",
    "link": "<URL of the article>",
    "story_summary": "<concise 8-9 line summary of the article>",
    "tags": ["<relevant_tag_1>", "<relevant_tag_2>", "<relevant_tag_3>"],
    "date": "<date of the article in YYYY-MM-DD format>",
    "sentiment": "<positive|negative|neutral>
    "image": "<image URL if available, otherwise omit it>"
  }
]

Instructions:
- \`story_summary\` must be **concise yet complete**, similar to a news digest (8-9 lines max). Focus on key details: what happened, who was involved, when, where, and why it matters.
- \`tags\` must be lowercase, no spaces or special characters. Use only relevant keywords (e.g., "politics", "sports", "technology", "entertainment", "business", "health", "world"). Do not exceed 3 tags.
- Return only a **valid minified JSON array** ‚Äî no markdown, no backticks, no extra explanation.
