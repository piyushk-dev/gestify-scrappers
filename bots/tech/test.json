The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) confirmed steam and gas emissions from the summit. Experts suggest a possible eruption in the coming weeks or months, but the timing remains uncertain. AVO noted a rise in gas emissions, suggesting fresh magma beneath the volcano.  Alert levels may increase with further signs of escalation like tremors, gas emissions, or surface changes. Hazards include ash clouds, ashfall, pyroclastic flows, and mudflows.",

Captured by the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter, the event occurred after a coronal mass ejection. The plasma structure reached 1.5 times the Sun's width, visible for three hours. Scientists attribute twisting movement to Alfvénic fluctuations. The study also addressed streaks in the video, confirming them as distant stars due to the imaging process.",

    "story_summary": "A new study reveals how bats avoid collisions during mass flights by adjusting their echolocation. Researchers tracked greater mouse-tailed bats, finding that bats adjust calls became shorter, weaker, and at a higher frequency. 94% of bats had their echolocations jammed exiting caves.  Bats prioritize detecting the nearest barrier by changing echolocation to gather precise information about their immediate surroundings. Within five seconds, the jamming decreased and bats moved outward while staying in formation.",
