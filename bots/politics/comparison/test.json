    "story_summary": "Amra Ram, the CPI(M) MP from Sikar, Rajasthan, has been inducted into the party's Politburo, making him the sole representative from North India in the executive body. Ram, 69, is a veteran farmer leader known for his ability to unite diverse groups, notably during the 2017 Sikar farmers' agitation demanding debt waivers and fair prices. He began his political career in student politics in 1978, later becoming a sarpanch and serving multiple terms as an MLA from Dhod and Danta Ramgarh, winning the Best MLA award in 2011. Despite numerous electoral defeats, including six Lok Sabha attempts since the 1990s, his persistence and deep roots in the farmer community of the Shekhawati region propelled his recent victory. His 2024 Lok Sabha win came with significant support from the Congress under the INDIA bloc alliance, capitalizing on anti-BJP sentiment among Jats in Shekhawati.",

    "story_summary": "The Congress party is holding a two-day All India Congress Committee (AICC) session in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, aiming to revitalize itself after recent electoral setbacks. Gujarat, a state the party hasn't won since 1995, was chosen symbolically to invoke Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, seeking to reclaim Patel's legacy from the BJP. This marks the first AICC session in Gujarat since 1961. The extended Working Committee will meet at the Sardar Patel Memorial, reinforcing the message. However, internal expectations remain modest regarding concrete outcomes like organizational reforms, given the poor implementation of resolutions from the 2022 Udaipur meeting. Leaders hope for clearer direction on countering the BJP and the strategy for the INDIA bloc. Resolutions are anticipated on key issues like inflation, unemployment, farmers' issues, and social justice, but the overall goal appears to be boosting morale rather than charting a detailed future course.",

He identifies a strong public desire for change from the established political order dominated by figures like Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, citing their age and health. Key issues fueling this demand, according to Kishor, include bureaucratic inefficiency (afsarshahi), corruption, migration, poor education, and unemployment. He criticizes both the NDA and INDIA bloc, particularly on the Waqf Act, positioning JSP as a genuine alternative, especially for Muslims. Kishor asserts that JSP is underestimated while the NDA, particularly Nitish Kumar, is overestimated. He believes JSP will field candidates proportionally across communities and become a major factor, influenced heavily by Nitish's perceived declining leadership capacity.",

The demonstrations led to the burning of the house of BJP Minority Morcha state president Asker Ali in Thoubal district after he initially supported the legislation; he later retracted his support and opposed the Act. Security has been heightened in response. The Meitei Pangals are Muslims who are part of the larger Meitei ethnic group, tracing their origins to settlers in the 17th century who assimilated Meitei culture and language. They constitute about 8.4% of Manipur's population. Historically, relations with the Hindu Meitei majority have seen tensions, notably the 1993 riots, after which Pangals were granted OBC status. Though not direct participants in the ongoing Meitei-Kuki conflict, they inhabit areas affected by the violence.",

LJP(RV) chief Chirag Paswan appealed for understanding from the Muslim community, invoking his father's legacy.

Sources suggest pressure from the BJP-led state government under CM Devendra Fadnavis was a key factor. The BJP reportedly feared alienating North Indian voters, particularly with Bihar elections looming, and worried the violence could tarnish Maharashtra's image as an investment hub aiming for a trillion-dollar economy. Concerns were also raised by industry sectors and bank unions. Thackeray maintained it wasn't a compromise but urged the government to enforce existing Marathi language laws.",

The new inductees include leaders like Jitendra Choudhury, Amra Ram, Vijoo Krishnan, and Mariam Dhawale, aiming for generational change. The Central Committee also saw 30 new members elected, following a rare contested election which hinted at internal differences, possibly regarding the general secretary choice. Despite this leadership refresh, the CPI(M) faces severe challenges: a shrinking national footprint (only 4 Lok Sabha seats), the need to revive fortunes in former strongholds West Bengal and Tripura, expand its base, and retain power in its last bastion, Kerala.
