    "title": "Trump blew lid off illusion, Modi nowhere to be seen: Rahul as bourses plunge over tariff turmoil",
    "story_summary": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating he was \"nowhere to be seen\" as Indian stock markets plunged significantly on Monday. Gandhi attributed the market turmoil to U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs, claiming Trump had \"blown the lid off the illusion\" of India's economic strength. He emphasized the need for India to build a resilient, production-based economy that works for all Indians. The sharp decline saw the BSE Sensex fall by over 2,226 points, its largest single-day drop in 10 months, while the NSE Nifty also tumbled. This mirrored a global market sell-off triggered by fears of an economic slowdown due to the U.S.-China trade tensions following Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent retaliation.",

The incident, which occurred near the park's boundary where cheetah Jwala and her cubs were close to human habitation, involved a daily wager driver giving water in a bowl. Officials stated this violated clear protocols requiring unauthorized staff to maintain distance from the animals. The staff were reportedly trying to lure the cheetahs back into the forest. The video sparked concerns about adherence to safety norms and wildlife handling procedures within the park, which is home to cheetahs translocated from Namibia and South Africa. Disciplinary action against the involved staff is underway.",

This disaster exacerbates the instability stemming from the 2021 military coup. The military junta controls much of the earthquake-affected zone, complicating aid delivery. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has made an unusual appeal for international aid, despite the regime's history of resisting foreign help (e.g., post-Cyclone Nargis 2008) and facing Western sanctions over the coup and Rohingya crisis. The international community grapples with providing aid without legitimizing the junta. ASEAN, along with neighbours like India and China, are key to coordinating relief efforts, potentially via the AHA Centre. Recommendations include discreet engagement, urging a ceasefire, and reviving international coordination mechanisms.",

This marks the first AICC session in Gujarat since 1961. The extended Working Committee will meet at the Sardar Patel Memorial, reinforcing the message. However, internal expectations remain modest regarding concrete outcomes like organizational reforms, given the poor implementation of resolutions from the 2022 Udaipur meeting.

    "story_summary": "Political strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, ahead of a rally for his Jan Suraaj party (JSP), outlined his vision for the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls. He identifies a strong public desire for change from the established political order dominated by figures like Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, citing their age and health. Key issues fueling this demand, according to Kishor, include bureaucratic inefficiency (afsarshahi), corruption, migration, poor education, and unemployment. He criticizes both the NDA and INDIA bloc, particularly on the Waqf Act, positioning JSP as a genuine alternative, especially for Muslims. Kishor asserts that JSP is underestimated while the NDA, particularly Nitish Kumar, is overestimated. He believes JSP will field candidates proportionally across communities and become a major factor, influenced heavily by Nitish's perceived declining leadership capacity.",

Ashok, a physician, became the national president of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), while Mariam became the national general secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). They married in 1994, emphasizing their shared political commitment. Though atheists now, Ashok comes from a Hindu background and Mariam from a Muslim one.

The demonstrations led to the burning of the house of BJP Minority Morcha state president Asker Ali in Thoubal district after he initially supported the legislation; he later retracted his support and opposed the Act. Security has been heightened in response. The Meitei Pangals are Muslims who are part of the larger Meitei ethnic group, tracing their origins to settlers in the 17th century who assimilated Meitei culture and language. They constitute about 8.4% of Manipur's population. Historically, relations with the Hindu Meitei majority have seen tensions, notably the 1993 riots, after which Pangals were granted OBC status. Though not direct participants in the ongoing Meitei-Kuki conflict, they inhabit areas affected by the violence.",

Their support for the Bill in Parliament has led to internal dissent, with several JD(U) Muslim leaders resigning. The opposition RJD, led by Tejashwi Yadav, is capitalizing on the situation, attacking CM Nitish Kumar's secular credentials and aiming to consolidate Muslim votes. Both JD(U) and LJP(RV) are attempting damage control. JD(U) insists the departing leaders are insignificant and defends the Bill as progressive. LJP(RV) chief Chirag Paswan appealed for understanding from the Muslim community, invoking his father's legacy. While some JD(U) leaders downplay the electoral impact, citing an already diminished Muslim vote share, the RJD believes the issue exposes the allies' compromises and will resonate with voters who value secularism.",

This directive came shortly after the campaign's launch on Gudi Padwa and followed significant backlash, including assaults on individuals like bank officials. Sources suggest pressure from the BJP-led state government under CM Devendra Fadnavis was a key factor. The BJP reportedly feared alienating North Indian voters, particularly with Bihar elections looming, and worried the violence could tarnish Maharashtra's image as an investment hub aiming for a trillion-dollar economy. Concerns were also raised by industry sectors and bank unions. Thackeray maintained it wasn't a compromise but urged the government to enforce existing Marathi language laws.",

Modi's visit reaffirmed his RSS roots ('swayamsevak') and acknowledged the BJP's reliance on the Sangh. In return, the RSS leadership signaled renewed backing for Modi.
