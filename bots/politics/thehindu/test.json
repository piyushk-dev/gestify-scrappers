    "story_summary": "Rahul Gandhi criticized PM Modi's handling of the economy after stock markets crashed due to US tariff hikes on April 7, 2025. He stated India must build a resilient, production-based economy. The Sensex plunged 2,226.79 points, its steepest decline in 10 months, amid global market turmoil. Gandhi accused Modi of being \"nowhere to be seen\" while the economy faces challenges. All Sensex shares, except Hindustan Unilever, experienced losses. The market decline reflects fears of an economic slowdown sparked by US-China trade tensions.",

International actors face challenges in providing aid independently. Civil society organizations are weak due to military rule. ASEAN and regional actors are expected to play a critical role in coordinating relief efforts. The disaster highlights the need for a collective approach to humanitarian aid.",
